# node-server

## Why Node.js ?
1. it makes building real-time apps (eg. chat or gaming) lightning fast,
2. It makes coding in JavaScript for both the client and server side possible,
3. it increases the efficiency of the development process as it fills the gap between frontend and backend developers (more on this later),
4. the ever-growing NPM (Node Package Manager) gives developers multiple tools and modules to use, thus further boosting their productivity,
5. code executes faster than in any other language,
6. Node is perfect for microservices which are a popular solution among enterprise apps.
